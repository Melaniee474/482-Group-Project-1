# 482-Group-Project Control System Design of Furuta Pendulum

## 1. Introduction 
-Furuta Pendulum, rotational inverted pendulum consists of a driven arm which rotates in the
horizontal plane and a pendulum attached to that arm which is free to rotate in the vertical plane. It was
invented in 1992 at Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta and his colleagues. The
problem that the team investigates with this project is creating a test platform for control system
algorithms -in a low-cost and streamlined fashion. In that regard, the project team is expected to create
a mathematical model of the system with a designed control system. The deliverables are listed in later
section.
